- 👋 Hi, this is @rainbowforgedev
- 👀 I’m interested in freelance web development work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning app development, php, svelte, and a few other things as well.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that work to build a more privacy friendly word wide web.
- 📫 Visit my portfolio website at https://rainbowforge.dev.
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them or no pronouns.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My name isn't actually Rainbow, I just go by that because I put it in my email footer along with pronouns, and my clients started calling me that, so now I just use that as my name for work :)
